## ⚠ Important stuff ⚠

> Install the [fonts](https://github.com/joaopcorrea/pedrofy/blob/main/Spotify-Font.zip) for a prettier project 😄


> Run both projects (`Pedrofy` and `Pedrofy-front`) at the same time ⌛


> ⛔📽 The project is currently focused on `Full HD`! Running at lower resolutions (such as `1366x720p`) will kinda sucks 😪


> And most importantly, **HAVE FUN!** 🎉
